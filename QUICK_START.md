### For Streamlit Cloud Deployment

**The error you're seeing (`uvx not found`) means you need to use cloud browser mode.**

#### Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Sign up for Browserbase** (free tier available)

   - Go to: https://www.browserbase.com/
   - Create account ‚Üí Create project
   - Copy your API Key and Project ID

2. **Add to Streamlit Secrets** (in your app settings):

   ```toml
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_key"
   USE_CLOUD_BROWSER = "true"
   BROWSERBASE_API_KEY = "your_browserbase_key"
   BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID = "your_project_id"
   ```

3. **Restart your Streamlit app**

That's it! The app will now use cloud browsers instead of trying to install Chrome locally.

## ‚ùì Why This Change?

**Problem**: Streamlit Cloud doesn't allow installing browsers (no sudo access)

**Solution**: Use Browserbase cloud browser service

**Cost**: Free tier available for testing
